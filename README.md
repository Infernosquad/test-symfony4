#Test Symfony 4 Project

My comments to code:

1. I didn't use any third party bundles like JmsSerializer or FosResBundle because I don't think it's necessary.

2. I used Symfony 4 because I wanted to try it. I usually work with Symfony LTS releases.

3. I don't use annontations in my normal practice. I prefer XML configration

Installation:

`composer install`

`php bin/console d:m:m --force`
